Some of the blogs I wrote around the past years, covering blockchain and cryptocurrencies, wrote for both the companies I worked for and also for a brazilian website 1bitcoin.com

Understand Blockchain Once and for All ‚Äì Using a Bus Line!
Many attempts have been made to explain blockchain using good analogies. Some compare it to pages in a book or a small village, but this time, the explanation becomes crystal clear with a dedicated website! That‚Äôs because the startup TxStreet has developed a simple way to visualize blockchain activity: each new block in the network is represented as a bus leaving the station, and each passenger on the bus is a transaction. So, to truly understand how blockchain works, just read this text and then have fun exploring the site!

Blockchain is a chain of blocks that allows numerous transactions to happen simultaneously. Unlike traditional systems that depend on a single entity validating transactions, blockchain relies on thousands of computers validating transactions together. These transactions are recorded in blocks, which remain permanently in the blockchain and cannot be reversed, as the movement is strictly linear.

How TxStreet Simplifies Blockchain
TxStreet innovates by illustrating blockchain blocks as buses leaving a station. Transactions, represented by passengers, start filling the bus. Depending on the blockchain being studied, each block (bus) is issued at different intervals.

Bitcoin‚Äôs blockchain takes minutes to release a new bus.
Ethereum‚Äôs blockchain issues new buses in less than ten seconds.
On the TxStreet website, you can see that transaction costs vary due to changes in blockchain traffic. The number of buses stays the same, but the number of passengers (transactions) fluctuates. This means that during peak activity, transaction fees increase, while during low activity, fees decrease‚Äîsince block production speed remains constant.

Why Understanding Blockchain Matters
Few people think about how the internet works, how cell phones were invented, or what technology powers social media. However, blockchain is a new technology, and because it involves money, it naturally raises questions about security and importance. Understanding how it works builds confidence in a technology that is gradually reshaping the economy and global markets.

If we extend the bus analogy, we must also understand who keeps the blockchain running: the miners! To sustain blockchain networks, computers continuously process information and solve mathematical problems to create new blocks. However, it‚Äôs not a single computer that validates transactions‚Äîit‚Äôs multiple computers confirming the same transaction. Those that validate incorrect information are excluded from the network, ensuring the integrity of blockchain data.

Miners are rewarded with the blockchain‚Äôs native cryptocurrency for their work, which is why the blockchain keeps moving forward.

Blockchain Adoption: The Future is Inevitable
With this knowledge, you now understand how blockchain works and why people invest time and energy in powerful machines to mine cryptocurrencies.

Over time, technical knowledge about blockchain will become less relevant, as most people will simply use blockchain-powered services because they are better, easier, and safer. However, until that day arrives, understanding why blockchain is secure and efficient gives you an early advantage, preparing you for the technology before mass adoption.

So, have you hopped on the blockchain bus yet? üöç

How to Study a Cryptocurrency?
Kim Kardashian was fined $1.25 million for improperly promoting a cryptocurrency on her social media. This highlights an important lesson: you can‚Äôt trust advertisements alone when evaluating a cryptocurrency. Instead, you must research independently.

Step 1: Check the Official Website & Whitepaper
Every cryptocurrency has a website and a whitepaper. The whitepaper outlines the project‚Äôs goals, technology, and economics. It should answer questions like:

How many tokens exist?
Can they be mined?
Does the token have a deflationary mechanism?
A weak whitepaper is a major red flag. If it lacks concrete details, the token is likely unreliable.

Step 2: Research the Founders
Always check who is behind the project.

Inexperienced teams should be approached cautiously.
Scammers who launched previous failed tokens are a red flag.
Anonymous founders often indicate potential scams, like rug-pulls (where developers disappear after selling tokens).
Step 3: Check Where the Token is Listed
See if the token is listed on trusted platforms like CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko.

Tokens listed on major exchanges (e.g., Binance, NovaDAX) are usually more reputable.
Tokens available only on decentralized platforms (e.g., PancakeSwap, SushiSwap) might still be unproven.
By analyzing the whitepaper, the team, and where it's listed, you‚Äôll gain a solid understanding of any cryptocurrency‚Äîwithout relying on celebrity endorsements.

What Changes with "The Merge" ‚Äì Ethereum‚Äôs Upgrade?
The biggest update in crypto history, The Merge, launched in September 2022, causing an Ethereum price surge. But what really changed, and what can we expect?

The Merge: Merging Ethereum‚Äôs Blockchains
The main change in The Merge is Ethereum‚Äôs transition from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS).

Old System (Proof of Work ‚Äì PoW): Miners use computers to solve complex problems and earn Ethereum.
New System (Proof of Stake ‚Äì PoS): Instead of mining, users lock their ETH to validate transactions and earn rewards.
This transition reduces energy consumption by 99.9%, making Ethereum more eco-friendly.

Why Could Ethereum‚Äôs Price Surge?
Ethereum‚Äôs deflationary update (EIP-1559) burns a portion of transaction fees, reducing the total ETH supply.

Since 2022, 1.875 million ETH (worth ~$5 billion) has been burned. This creates scarcity, making ETH more valuable over time‚Äîsimilar to Bitcoin.

If Ethereum continues innovating, this update could be one of the biggest crypto revolutions ever.

The Merge: Quick Facts
When? September 15, 2022
Biggest Change? Shift from PoW to PoS, reducing energy consumption by 99.9%
Impact on NFT games? Ethereum-based games (like Axie Infinity) paused operations to avoid disruptions.
Blockchain split risk? Possible, leading to a hard fork (a new blockchain).
New token? If a hard fork happens, holders might receive new tokens (in addition to ETH).
Cryptocurrencies Are Booming in Argentina
With 71% inflation, four economy ministers in a year, and a rapidly devaluing peso, Argentina has turned to crypto as a safe haven.

Why Are Argentinians Using Crypto?
Due to government-imposed limits on buying dollars ($200 per month), Argentinians rushed to stablecoins and Bitcoin to protect their wealth.

USDC (stablecoin) traded 2-3x higher than its official value in Argentina.
Many prefer storing money in crypto wallets over banks, fearing government seizures.
Crypto‚Äôs Role in Financial Freedom
Cryptocurrencies offer financial sovereignty, ensuring people control their assets without interference.

During the Ukraine war, many fled with their savings in crypto, proving its value for economic security.
Mastercard is now working to integrate crypto payments in 90 million stores, signaling mass adoption.
Final Thoughts
Crypto is not just a speculative asset‚Äîit‚Äôs becoming a lifeline for people in unstable economies. While it‚Äôs not yet a common daily payment method, adoption is only a matter of time.
